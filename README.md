# üß† Facial Recognition Attendance System

A Python-based facial recognition attendance system that automatically detects and recognizes faces through a webcam and marks attendance by saving data into log files. This project uses OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library for real-time face detection and recognition.

## üìÅ Project Structure
facial-rec-attendance-system/
- facealrec2.0.py # Main script to run the facial recognition attendance system
- facial rec.rar # Compressed version of the entire project (for backup or sharing)
- attendance_logs/ # Folder to store CSV files of daily attendance
- known_faces/ # Folder containing known face images (used for recognition)

## üß© Required Modules

Install the following dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install cmake
pip install face_recognition
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anushkarao12/facial-rec-attendance-system.git
cd facial-rec-attendance-system
```
2. Ensure your webcam is working and you have sample face images in the known_faces/ folder (with filenames as person names).

3. Run the Python script:
```bash
python facealrec.py
```
4. When a known face is detected, attendance is logged in the attendance_logs/ folder in a .csv file with the current date.

## üß† How It Works

- Loads images of known faces from the known_faces/ folder.
- Initializes webcam and captures live video.
- Uses face_recognition to detect and identify faces.
- If a face matches one in the dataset, its name is logged with the current time and date.
- Avoids duplicate attendance entries during the same session.
